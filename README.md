# House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning (linear regression) to predict house prices based on various features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.

## Features Used
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Stories
- Mainroad, Guestroom, Basement (binary values)
- Parking
- Airconditioning
- Prefarea (Preferred Area)
- Furnishing Status (furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for a machine learning project that predicts house prices. The model was built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Setup Instructions
Make sure you have the following installed on your local system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Running Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda

If you don't have Python installed separately on your system, you can still run this project using Anaconda, which includes Jupyter Notebook and all the necessary libraries.

### Steps:

1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda comes with Python and Jupyter Notebook pre-installed.
   
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook from there. This will open Jupyter in your browser.

3. **Run the Project**: Navigate to the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to execute the project.
